We want to motivate all robotics enthusiasts and students to participate regardless of whether they have enough money for \"official\" LEGO kits. We believe that success in the competition should depend primarily on talent, diligence, and sporting luck. We understand the concerns of \"official\" kit users that they might be at a disadvantage compared to other contestants, e.g., due to weaker motors or batteries. However, they can find inspiration at our competition and also connect stronger (\"unofficial\") components to their official kits.",
